GFLOW_Utilities
===============

Utilities for working with GFLOW:

This repository contains a set of python programs for performing advanced modeling with the 
analytic element groundwater flow model, GFLOW (Haitjema, 2005).  The programs were originally
written to facilitate application of Monte Carlo methods to incorporate uncertainty in mapping
areas contributing recharge to wells.  Additional programs have been added.  Contact the author,
